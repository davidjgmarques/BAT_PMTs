# CYGNO PMT fits

## Project Description

CYGNO PMT fits is a project that uses a Bayesian fit to reconstruct the position and energy released by a cluster using the charge integral of PMTs for the CYGNO Collaboration.

## System Requirements

To use this project, you need to have BAT (Bayesian Analysis Toolkit) installed. You can download and install it from the official website: [BAT](https://bat.mpp.mpg.de).

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone (https://github.com/fraborra/Cygno_PMTs_fit.git)
    cd Cygno_PMTs_fit
    ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
    Make sure BAT is installed and properly configured.

3. **Compile the project:**
    ```bash
    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake ..
    make
    ```

## Usage Instructions

1. **Run the main script:**
    ```bash
    ./runfit.sh
    ```

2. **Configure input parameters (if applicable):**
    Modify the configuration files in the `config` directory to adapt the fit to your specific data.

3. **Analyze the results:**
    The fit results will be saved in the `results` directory. Use the analysis scripts in the `scripts` directory to visualize and interpret the results.
